been trobleshooting. See chat with claude:



This is extremely frustrating, and I understand your persistence through all these troubleshooting steps. The fact that /dev/kfd and /dev/dri are still missing after a complete WSL2 reset means we have a fundamental issue with AMD GPU passthrough to WSL2 on your system.

Given that you've already tried:



✅ Fresh WSL2 installation

✅ Windows updates

✅ AMD driver reinstallation with factory reset

✅ Hyper-V and WSL features enabled

✅ System reboots

Let's try a few more targeted approaches:



Option 1: Check Your Current AMD Driver Status

First, let's verify your AMD drivers are actually working in Windows:

In Windows (not WSL2), open Device Manager:



Right-click Start Menu → Device Manager

Expand "Display adapters"

Look for your AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT

Right-click it → Properties → Driver tab

Can you tell me:



What driver version is shown?

Is there any yellow warning triangle or error icon?

Option 2: Try the .wslconfig Fix

Create a WSL configuration file that might help with GPU passthrough:

In Windows, navigate to your user folder: C:\Users\Username\

Create a new file called .wslconfig (with the dot at the beginning) with this content:





[wsl2]kernelCommandLine = amd_iommu=on iommu=ptmemory=8GBprocessors=4

After creating this file:



Open PowerShell as Admin

Run: wsl --shutdown

Reboot your PC

Open WSL2 Ubuntu and test: ls -la /dev/kfd /dev/dri

Option 3: Alternative Approach - Use CPU-only Ollama

If GPU passthrough continues to fail, we can modify your setup to run Ollama on CPU instead of GPU. This will be slower but will work:

In your docker-compose.yml, change:





yaml

# FROM THIS:image: ollama/ollama:rocm# TO THIS:image: ollama/ollama:latest

And remove the GPU-related lines:





yaml

# REMOVE THESE LINES:devices: - /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd - /dev/dri:/dev/dricap_add: - SYS_PTRACEsecurity_opt: - seccomp:unconfined

Which would you like to try first?

The .wslconfig approach (Option 2) has the best chance of fixing the underlying GPU passthrough issue. If that doesn't work, we can fall back to CPU-only mode (Option 3) to at least get your system running.

What's your preference?

Option 1: see screenshot.

Driver version: 32.0.21001.9024

Option 2: my current .wslconfig content:

[wsl2]

memory=24GB

processors=12

swap=8GB

localhostForwarding=true

nestedVirtualization=true

kernelCommandLine = nomodeset

I changed it to:

[wsl2]

memory=8GB

processors=4

swap=8GB

localhostForwarding=true

nestedVirtualization=true

kernelCommandLine = amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

I got:

jerryagenyi@JA-W11:~$ ls -la /dev/kfd /dev/dri

ls: cannot access '/dev/kfd': No such file or directory

ls: cannot access '/dev/dri': No such file or directory

I changed it to just what you suggested:

[wsl2]

kernelCommandLine = amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

memory=8GB

processors=4

then ended wsl and reboot. same result:

jerryagenyi@JA-W11:~$ ls -la /dev/kfd /dev/dri

ls: cannot access '/dev/kfd': No such file or directory

ls: cannot access '/dev/dri': No such file or directory

I edited docker-compose. changed to ollama/ollama:lates; removed "devices: - /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd - /dev/dri:/dev/dri"; could not find: "cap_add: - SYS_PTRACE security_opt: - seccomp:unconfined" (i attached the old yml file to show you how it was before i changed it. i kept getting docker compose issues even after starting the docker desktop app:

is there a way we can bypass this and still run ollama? I am so tired.

Edit

I completely understand your frustration - you've been incredibly patient through all of this! The good news is we're very close to getting this working.

The issue now is that when you reset WSL2, Docker Desktop lost its connection to your new Ubuntu installation. This is a common issue and easy to fix.



Fix Docker Desktop Integration

Open Docker Desktop (the Windows application)

Go to Settings:Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner

Navigate to Resources → WSL Integration:On the left sidebar: Resources → WSL Integration

Enable WSL Integration:Toggle ON "Enable integration with my default WSL distro"

Under "Enable integration with additional distros", toggle ON "Ubuntu-24.04" (or whatever your distro is called)

Apply & Restart:Click "Apply & Restart"

Wait for Docker Desktop to restart

Test Docker in WSL2:

bash

docker --version

Updated docker-compose.yml for CPU-only

Since we're switching to CPU-only mode, here's your updated docker-compose.yml:

docker-compose.yml (CPU-only version)

Code 

# Docker Compose file for Llama Local Server

# CPU-only version (no GPU dependencies)



version: '3.8'



services:

ollama:

image: ollama/ollama:latest

container_name: llama-ollama

restart: unless-stopped

ports:

- "${INTERNAL_POR

What I removed:

Changed ollama/ollama:rocm to ollama/ollama:latest (CPU version)

Removed all GPU-related lines:devices: section

group_add: section

Once Docker Desktop integration is fixed:



bash

# Navigate to your projectcd /mnt/c/Users/Username/OneDrive/Documents/jerry-dev/github/local-llama-wsl2-server# Start the servicesdocker compose up -d

Performance Notes:

CPU-only will be slower than GPU, but it will work reliably

For smaller models (7B parameters), CPU performance is often acceptable

You can always switch back to GPU later if we figure out the passthrough issue

Try the Docker Desktop WSL integration fix first, then let me know if docker --version works in your WSL2 terminal!

Edit

Great! Docker is now installed and working. The permission error is a common issue with Docker in WSL2. Let's fix this:



Fix Docker Permissions

You need to add your user to the docker group:





bash

# Add your user to the docker groupsudo usermod -aG docker $USER# Apply the group membership (this refreshes your groups)newgrp docker

If that doesn't work immediately, try:





bash

# Alternative: restart the docker servicesudo service docker restart# Then try the newgrp command againnewgrp docker

Test Docker Access

After running the commands above, test if Docker works without sudo:





bash

docker ps

If you still get permission errors, you might need to restart your WSL2 terminal:



Close your current Ubuntu terminal

Open a fresh Ubuntu terminal

Navigate back to your project directory:

bash

cd /mnt/c/Users/Username/OneDrive/Documents/jerry-dev/github/local-llama-wsl2-server

Once Docker Permissions are Fixed

Try running your compose again:





bash

docker compose up -d

Update your docker-compose.yml

Also, you can remove that version: '3.8' line from your docker-compose.yml to get rid of that warning. Modern Docker Compose doesn't need it.

Let me know what output you get after trying the sudo usermod -aG docker $USER and newgrp docker commands!

Edit

🎉 EXCELLENT! Your Llama server is now running successfully!

All containers are up and running:



✅ llama-ollama - Your AI model server

✅ llama-nginx - Web server/proxy

✅ llama-tunnel - Cloudflare tunnel

✅ llama-watchtower - Auto-updater

Next Steps: Test Your Server

Check if Ollama is responding:

bash

curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

Check container status:

bash

docker compose ps

View logs if needed:

bash

# View all logsdocker compose logs# View just Ollama logsdocker compose logs ollama

Download and Run Your First Model

Once Ollama is confirmed working, you can download a model:





bash

# Enter the Ollama containerdocker compose exec ollama bash# Inside the container, pull a model (start with a smaller one)ollama pull llama3.2:3b# Or a larger one if you want better qualityollama pull llama3.2:8b# Exit the containerexit

Test the Model

After downloading a model, you can test it:





bash

# Test via APIcurl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{ "model": "llama3.2:3b", "prompt": "Hello, how are you?", "stream": false}'

Clean Up the Warning

You can remove the version: '3.8' line from your docker-compose.yml to eliminate that warning, but it's not critical.

Congratulations on getting through all that troubleshooting! While we couldn't get GPU acceleration working, you now have a fully functional CPU-based Llama server. CPU performance is still quite good for many use cases, especially with smaller models.

What would you like to try first - checking the server status or downloading a model?

Show thinking
Excellent work! You've pushed through a lot of troubleshooting and successfully got your Llama server running in CPU-only mode. That's a huge achievement, especially after all the challenges with the GPU passthrough.

Let's break down your latest output:

Docker Integration & Permissions Resolved:
The output:

jerryagenyi@JA-W11:/mnt/c/Users/Username/OneDrive/Documents/jerry-dev/github/local-llama-wsl2-server$ docker --version
Docker version 28.1.1, build 4eba377
And the subsequent successful docker compose up -d prove that you've successfully integrated Docker Desktop with your WSL2 distribution and fixed the permissions. This was a critical step!

This is fantastic! All your services are now Started.

Ollama is Working (CPU-only):

curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags returning {"models":[]} is the correct response for an Ollama instance that has no models downloaded yet.
You successfully used ollama pull llama3.2:3b to download the model. The Ctrl+C interruption during the first attempt is why you needed to pull it again, but it completed successfully on the second try.
Most importantly, you successfully sent a prompt to llama3.2:3b and received a response!

This confirms your Llama server is fully functional in CPU mode.
"Unhealthy" Status for Ollama and Nginx:
When you ran docker compose ps, it showed llama-ollama and llama-nginx as (unhealthy).

For Ollama: The logs show time=2025-05-31T10:56:47.630Z level=INFO source=gpu.go:377 msg="no compatible GPUs were discovered". This is expected and good, as you've switched to the CPU-only ollama/ollama:latest image and removed the GPU device passthrough from your docker-compose.yml. Ollama correctly identified it's running on CPU.
The "unhealthy" status in docker compose ps often means the container's health check hasn't passed yet, or its criteria are a bit strict/slow. Since you were able to curl Ollama and get a response, the service is working correctly. You can ignore this "unhealthy" status for now as long as your applications are working. Nginx likely shows unhealthy because it expects Ollama to be healthy before it can connect.
Summary of Success and Next Steps:
You now have a fully operational Llama server running on your CPU! This is a big win.

Next Steps:

Check Cloudflare Tunnel Status:
Go to your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard (Access > Tunnels). Your "wsl2-on-local-w11" tunnel should now be "HEALTHY". This means your server is accessible publicly through Cloudflare.

Experiment with Models:
You've successfully pulled llama3.2:3b. You can continue to interact with it via curl or set up a UI if you have one.
You can also try pulling other models. Note the Error: pull model manifest: file does not exist for llama3.2:8b and llama3.2:11b – these specific models (llama3.2) might not exist, as llama3 and llama3:8b are more common. Stick to known models from ollama.com/library.

Clean Up the version Warning (Optional):
To remove the WARN[0000] ... the attribute version is obsolete message, simply open your docker-compose.yml file and delete the line that says version: '3.8'. It's purely cosmetic now, but good to clean up.

Regarding the GPU issue:
We can definitively say that the GPU passthrough to WSL2 for your AMD RX 6800 XT remains an unsolved problem on your system. It's a complex area, and sometimes specific hardware/driver combinations or very deep Windows configurations can prevent it. However, by switching to CPU mode, you've successfully bypassed this blocker and have a functional local LLM server.

Congratulations again on getting this far! What would you like to do next? Would you like to check your Cloudflare tunnel, or start experimenting with different models?

tried to pull llB parameter but says nothing like that. what i saw is "**original-llama3.2-vision"**. I guess that does only vision right? or i can still use it for general tasks - text especially and image once in a while? or what if i run "**dolphin-llama3**

Dolphin 2.9 is a new model with 8B and 70B sizes by Eric Hartford based on Llama 3 that has a variety of instruction, conversational, and coding skills." or "**GandalfBaum/llama3.2-claude3.7**

I just want something better than 3B parameter of the 3.2 to get fair game for general llm use without breaking my PC esepcailly since gpu access is unavailable at the moment.



Aso given the problems I just went through, what would be the ifeal system requirements to run llamal locally on wsl, especially the gpu part? like compatibility checks to watch out for. I also had to modify the docker-compose.yml. I want to now what the standard is, and my workaround and how they compare, so when i am blogging about it, i could state these. i am setting up and plan to blog based on the attached document llama-local-server-guide.md. Also see the chnages from the original docker file to the modified docker compose file using cpu only.

This is an excellent set of questions for your blog, and it's great to see you're documenting your journey. Let's break down your model choices, system requirements, and the differences in the docker-compose.yml for your blogging purposes.

Choosing a Better LLM Model for CPU-Only Use
You're right, llama3.2:3b is quite small. It's good for quick tests but lacks depth. When running on CPU, model size directly impacts speed.

original-llama3.2-vision: As the name suggests, "vision" models are designed for multimodal tasks (text and images). While they can often process text, their architecture is optimised for vision, and they might not be as performant or efficient for purely text-based generation compared to a text-only model of the same size. If you want occasional image capabilities, this could be an option, but for primary text tasks, a text-focused model is usually better.
dolphin-llama3 (8B or 70B):
8B models: An 8B parameter model is a significant step up from 3B in quality and capability. With your Ryzen 7 5800x and 32GB RAM, an 8B model on CPU is generally a very reasonable choice for general LLM use. It will be slower than on a GPU, but often quite usable for conversational AI and various text tasks.
70B models: A 70B model on CPU is going to be extremely slow on your system. It would likely take several minutes (or more) to generate a single response. While your 32GB RAM is good, running a 70B model typically benefits immensely from GPU acceleration (ideally 40GB+ VRAM or distributed across multiple GPUs). On your CPU, it would be a crawl.
GandalfBaum/llama3.2-claude3.7: This sounds like a fine-tuned model based on Llama 3.2. Its performance would depend on its parameter size. If it's an 8B model, it would likely be a good candidate.
Recommendation for CPU-only:
Given your specs and the desire for "fair game for general LLM use without breaking my PC," I'd highly recommend focusing on 7B or 8B parameter models based on Llama 3. dolphin-llama3:8b sounds like an excellent candidate for general use, as its description highlights instruction, conversation, and coding skills.

You can browse available models and their sizes on the Ollama Library. Look for models like llama3:8b, mixtral:8x7b (Mixtral is larger but has a "sparse" architecture that can sometimes perform better on CPU for its size), or fine-tunes of Llama 3 around the 8B mark.

How to assess performance:
The curl output you showed already gives you performance metrics:
"total_duration":6663320972 (around 6.6 seconds) for llama3.2:3b.
"prompt_eval_duration":1045639163 (around 1 second) for processing the prompt.
"eval_duration":2857940809 (around 2.8 seconds) for generating the 50 tokens of response.

When you try an 8B model, you'll see these numbers increase. It's a trade-off between quality and inference speed.

Ideal System Requirements for Local Llama (Especially GPU)
This is a great point for your blog!

General Requirements:
RAM: For efficient CPU-only inference, more RAM is always better.
7B/8B models: 16GB minimum, 32GB recommended for comfort and multitasking.
Mixtral 8x7B (sparse): 32GB minimum, 64GB recommended.
70B models: 64GB+ (if you're brave enough for CPU only).
CPU: Modern multi-core CPUs with good single-core and multi-core performance are key. Your Ryzen 7 5800x (8 cores, 16 threads) is excellent for this.
Storage: Fast NVMe SSDs are highly recommended for storing models and for swap space if RAM runs low. Your 1TB NVMe SSD is perfect.
GPU-Specific Requirements (for future reference/blogging):
VRAM (Video RAM): This is the single most critical factor for GPU-accelerated LLMs. More VRAM allows you to load larger models.
Minimum for 7B/8B models: 8GB VRAM
Recommended for 7B/8B models: 12GB+ VRAM
Recommended for Mixtral 8x7B: 24GB+ VRAM (some quantised versions might fit in 16GB, but it's tight)
Recommended for 70B models: 48GB+ VRAM (e.g., RTX 4090, or multiple GPUs)
GPU Architecture:
NVIDIA: Most widely supported via CUDA. Any modern (RTX 20/30/40 series, GTX 16 series) GPU with sufficient VRAM works well.
AMD: Support primarily via ROCm (ROCm is AMD's equivalent to CUDA). This is where your RX 6800 XT (16GB VRAM) comes in. It's a fantastic card for LLMs if ROCm is properly configured and detected. Your card, being RDNA2, is officially supported by ROCm 5.x.
Compatibility Check for AMD:
ROCm Version: Ensure your driver stack and desired ROCm version are compatible. Ollama usually bundles a specific ROCm version, but the underlying Windows/WSL2 setup needs to support it.
WSL2 Integration: The ability for WSL2 to expose /dev/kfd and /dev/dri is paramount. This relies on:
Latest Windows updates (especially for WSL).
Latest GPU drivers (WHQL, clean install).
WSL features enabled (Hyper-V, Virtual Machine Platform, WSL).
A compatible WSL2 Linux kernel (your 6.6.87.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 is good).
Sometimes, specific .wslconfig entries (kernelCommandLine = amd_iommu=on iommu=pt) can help, but it's not a guarantee.
Your docker-compose.yml Changes for Blogging
This is perfect for demonstrating your troubleshooting journey.

Original docker-compose.yml (GPU Attempt - Concept)
The original version would have included specific sections to expose the GPU devices to the Ollama container. This is the "standard" way to enable GPU access for Ollama in Docker on WSL2 with ROCm.

YAML

# Original (conceptual) docker-compose.yml for GPU acceleration

version: '3.8' # This line becomes obsolete in modern Docker Compose

services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:rocm # Specifies the ROCm-enabled image for AMD GPUs
    container_name: llama-ollama
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}:${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}" # e.g., 11434:11434
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama # Mounts a Docker volume for persistent model storage
      - ${MODELS_PATH}:/root/.ollama/models # Or mount a specific host directory for models
    # --- GPU-specific configuration START ---
    devices:
      - /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd # Passes through the Kernel Fusion Device for AMD ROCm
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri # Passes through Direct Rendering Infrastructure devices
    cap_add:
      - SYS_PTRACE # Often required for debugging/introspection with GPU containers
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined # Sometimes needed for GPU containers to bypass strict security policies
    # --- GPU-specific configuration END ---
    environment:
      # Common Ollama environment variables
      - OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}
      - OLLAMA_MODELS=/root/.ollama/models
      # ROCm-specific environment variables (might be optional or context-dependent)
      - HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 # Sometimes helpful for RDNA2/3 cards if ROCm isn't auto-detecting
    # ... other services like nginx, cloudflared, watchtower ...

volumes:
  ollama_data:
    external: true # Or define as local if not pre-created
Your Modified docker-compose.yml (CPU-Only Workaround)
Your current working version removes the GPU-specific parts and uses the generic Ollama image.

YAML

# Modified docker-compose.yml for CPU-only operation (your current working version)

# version: '3.8' # This line can now be removed to silence the warning

services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest # Changed to the CPU-only image
    container_name: llama-ollama
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}:${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}"
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama
      - ${MODELS_PATH}:/root/.ollama/models
    # --- REMOVED GPU-specific configuration ---
    # No 'devices:' section
    # No 'cap_add:' section
    # No 'security_opt:' section
    # No ROCm-specific environment variables (e.g., HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION)
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}
      - OLLAMA_MODELS=/root/.ollama/models
    # ... other services like nginx, cloudflared, watchtower ...

volumes:
  ollama_data:
    external: true
Comparison for your blog:

Standard (GPU): Aims for high performance by leveraging the GPU. Requires specific image (:rocm for AMD, :cuda for NVIDIA) and passing through /dev/kfd and /dev/dri (or NVIDIA equivalents) devices, plus potentially cap_add and security_opt for container permissions to access hardware. This is the ideal goal.
Workaround (CPU): Bypasses GPU acceleration when passthrough fails. Simpler docker-compose.yml as no device passthrough is needed. Uses the :latest (CPU-enabled) Ollama image. Trade-off: slower inference, but ensures functionality. This is your current successful setup.
Tips on Trying to Fix GPU Passthrough in Future:
You've explored the main avenues, but here are some specific areas to focus on if you return to this:

Windows Driver Store Corruption:

Sometimes the Windows driver store (C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository) can get corrupted or hold onto old driver versions that interfere.
A very advanced step would involve manually cleaning this (after extensive research, as it can break your system). Tools like DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) exist for this, but are for advanced users and can cause instability if misused. Only attempt this if you're comfortable with deep system changes and have full backups.
Specific WSL Kernel Module for AMD:

While WSL2 is supposed to handle this, occasionally the kernel module for AMD (amdgpu and related kfd) might not load correctly or have issues.
You could try to manually verify if the modules are loaded in WSL2: lsmod | grep amdgpu and lsmod | grep kfd. If they are, but /dev/kfd is missing, it's a deeper issue.
Some users have reported success with specific versions of ROCm from AMD's website directly installed within WSL2 (not just via Docker). This is very complex and can break WSL2.
Firmware/BIOS Settings:

Ensure "Above 4G Decoding" (or "Re-Size BAR Support") and "SR-IOV" (if available, usually for server/workstation GPUs) are enabled in your motherboard's BIOS. These can impact how the system allocates resources for GPUs, especially for virtualisation. Your Gigabyte B550 board should have these options.
Windows Version Specificity & Bugs:

Keep an eye on official Microsoft WSL blog posts and GitHub issues (on the microsoft/WSL repository) for known issues related to AMD GPU passthrough with specific Windows builds or WSL versions. It's possible there's a bug that gets patched.
Ollama Community & GitHub Issues:

Check the Ollama GitHub issues and discussion forums. Others with RX 6800 XT and WSL2 might have found specific workarounds or confirmed bugs. Search for terms like "RX 6800 XT WSL2 /dev/kfd" there.
For your blog, you can emphasise that while your RX 6800 XT should be capable of GPU acceleration, the software stack (Windows, WSL2, AMD drivers, Docker, Ollama) has many layers, and sometimes a specific configuration or bug prevents them from collaborating perfectly. Your CPU-only solution is a robust workaround that gets the job done.

You have all the information you need for your blog post now. Good luck with your writing and your continued LLM exploration!

Which can i use that has a larger context window, as the window gets used up pretty quickly.



Also since "AMD: Support primarily via ROCm (ROCm is AMD's equivalent to CUDA). This is where your RX 6800 XT (16GB VRAM) comes in. It's a fantastic card for LLMs if ROCm is properly configured and detected. Your card, being RDNA2, is officially supported by ROCm 5.x." my system supports ROCm, how about i install ollama locally and pull models i want, then expose it to WSL? I figure that ollama running locally on Windows PC will have access to the GPU before we open a port for it to WSL? Or even try sending it dorectly to cloudflare tunnel and let everything connect to it from there, including WSL if necessary?



You're asking all the right questions to get the most out of your local LLM setup!

Models with Larger Context Windows
You're right, GandalfBaum/llama3.2-claude3.7 at 2.0GB (which is indeed 3B parameters) won't offer a significant step up from llama3.2:3b. The "128K context" is impressive, but for a 3B model, its ability to utilise that massive context effectively might be limited, and it will still be slow on CPU.

For a larger context window on CPU, while also trying to balance performance on your system, you should look for models that explicitly state a larger context and are around the 7B-8B parameter range.

Here are some models from the Ollama library that are commonly used and offer decent context windows, often with 8B parameters, which would be a good fit for your 32GB RAM on CPU:

llama3:8b: The standard Llama 3 8B model. This is a very strong general-purpose model. It usually has a default context window of 8K, which is significantly larger than the typical 4K of older models and is a good balance for CPU use.
Pull command: ollama pull llama3:8b
mixtral:8x7b: This is a "Mixture of Experts" (MoE) model. While it has 8 "experts" of 7B parameters each, it only activates a few of them per token generation, making it surprisingly efficient for its perceived size. It's often recommended for good performance and quality on systems with sufficient RAM (your 32GB is fine for the base version). It typically has a 32K context window.
Pull command: ollama pull mixtral:8x7b
Fine-tuned Llama 3 8B models: Look for community-fine-tuned Llama 3 8B models (e.g., from users like dolphin-llama3:8b, which you mentioned). These often have improved instruction following or specific capabilities and inherit the Llama 3's context window.
Recommendation: I would start with llama3:8b or mixtral:8x7b. llama3:8b is a solid upgrade from the 3B. mixtral:8x7b will likely be a bit slower on CPU than llama3:8b due to its actual size, but it offers excellent quality and a larger context.

Running Ollama Locally on Windows PC (Native Install)
This is an excellent idea and definitely worth trying! You're thinking strategically.

Here's why this approach has a strong chance of enabling GPU acceleration:

Direct GPU Access: When Ollama is installed directly on Windows, it interacts with your AMD GPU drivers directly, without the abstraction layer of WSL2. This bypasses the /dev/kfd and /dev/dri issues you've been facing with WSL2's virtualisation.
ROCm on Windows: Ollama on Windows with AMD GPUs directly leverages the installed AMD drivers that come with ROCm compatibility (for supported cards like yours).
Proposed Setup:

Install Ollama on Windows:

Go to ollama.com/download.
Download the Windows installer.
Run the installer. It will typically install Ollama as a service that runs in the background.
By default, Ollama on Windows will try to use your GPU if it detects a compatible one (which it should for your RX 6800 XT).
Verify Ollama is using GPU on Windows:

Open Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Run ollama run llama3:8b (or any model, you'll need to pull it first).
When the model starts loading, Ollama will usually print messages indicating if it's using the GPU. Look for lines like "using cuda" or "using rocm" or similar. If it says "using cpu," then there's still a driver issue on the Windows side.
Access Ollama from WSL2 (via LAN):

Once Ollama is running on Windows (and hopefully using the GPU), it will be listening on http://localhost:11434 (or http://127.0.0.1:11434).
From your WSL2 Ubuntu terminal, you can access it directly at that address because WSL2's networking automatically forwards localhost to the Windows host.
Test it:
Bash

curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
This curl command should now hit the Ollama server running natively on Windows, and therefore be GPU-accelerated.
Adjust docker-compose.yml (No Ollama container needed):
If you run Ollama natively on Windows, you would remove the ollama service from your docker-compose.yml.
Your Nginx and Cloudflare Tunnel containers would then point to the Windows-native Ollama server instead of a Docker container for Ollama.

How to modify docker-compose.yml for this:

Remove the ollama service entirely.
In the nginx service, change the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable to host.docker.internal:11434. This is a special DNS name that Docker Desktop provides to access services running directly on the Windows host machine.
Your docker-compose.yml would look something like this (simplified):

YAML

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: llama-nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${EXTERNAL_NGINX_PORT}:80" # e.g., 8080:80
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=http://host.docker.internal:11434 # Pointing to Windows-native Ollama
      # ... other nginx env vars ...
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro
    depends_on:
      # Nginx depends on Cloudflared for connection, but now it *logically* depends on Windows Ollama
      - cloudflared

  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: llama-tunnel
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN}
      - CLOUDFLARED_OPTS=--no-autoupdate tunnel --url http://host.docker.internal:${EXTERNAL_NGINX_PORT} # Pointing to Nginx which points to Windows Ollama
    # ... other cloudflared config ...

  watchtower:
    # ... watchtower service as before ...
This would give you full GPU acceleration for Ollama via Windows, while keeping your Nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel, and Watchtower in Docker/WSL2.

This native Windows Ollama install strategy is a very promising path to getting your GPU (RX 6800 XT) fully engaged with Ollama! It simplifies the WSL2 GPU passthrough problem by bypassing it.

Let's try this native Windows install for Ollama next.





what if i run the ollama on docker desktop on windows, given that wsl uses docker desktop, and docker desktop is running first before wsl connects to it?


That's an insightful question and a very good point! You're absolutely right to consider running the ollama container directly through Docker Desktop on Windows.

Here's why your idea makes perfect sense and how it compares to the native Windows install and the WSL2-based Docker install:

Running Ollama as a Docker Container via Docker Desktop on Windows
How it works:
When you enable WSL integration in Docker Desktop, Docker Desktop effectively runs a small Linux VM (a WSL2 distro created by Docker) which hosts the Docker daemon. Any docker run or docker compose commands you issue, whether from Windows PowerShell/CMD or your WSL2 Ubuntu terminal, are ultimately processed by this Docker Desktop-managed daemon.

The key difference here is where the container is told to access the GPU.

Your current setup (WSL2 Docker, CPU-only): The Docker daemon itself runs in a WSL2 VM. When you told it to use the ollama/ollama:rocm image and tried to pass /dev/kfd and /dev/dri from your specific Ubuntu-24.04 WSL2 instance, that's where the GPU passthrough failed.
Running Ollama directly via Docker Desktop (GPU-enabled): Docker Desktop has its own way of exposing the Windows host's GPU to containers run through its daemon. This often bypasses the need for /dev/kfd and /dev/dri to be present in your specific user-created WSL2 distro. Docker Desktop handles the virtualisation to the GPU.
Advantages of this approach:

Likely GPU Acceleration: Docker Desktop is designed to pass through the host GPU to containers. If your AMD drivers are correctly installed on Windows, Docker Desktop should be able to leverage them for the ollama/ollama:rocm container. This is a primary benefit.
Clean Separation: Your Ollama service (the resource-intensive part) runs in a separate, GPU-accelerated container managed directly by Docker Desktop.
Consistency: You're still using Docker Compose for your other services, which is consistent with your existing setup.
Bypasses WSL2 GPU Passthrough Issues: You avoid the specific /dev/kfd and /dev/dri problems within your Ubuntu-24.04 distro.
How to Implement This:
We will essentially revert your ollama service in docker-compose.yml to its GPU-enabled form, but tell Docker Desktop to handle the GPU access itself.

Revert/Update docker-compose.yml for Ollama (GPU-enabled):
You need to put back the devices, cap_add, and security_opt sections for the ollama service. This time, ensure you use the ollama/ollama:rocm image.

YAML

# docker-compose.yml for GPU acceleration via Docker Desktop

# You can remove the "version: '3.8'" line to silence the warning
# version: '3.8'

services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:rocm # Use the ROCm-enabled image
    container_name: llama-ollama
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}:${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}" # e.g., 11434:11434
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama
      - ${MODELS_PATH}:/root/.ollama/models # Make sure this path is accessible by Docker Desktop (usually C:\ or D:\)
    # --- GPU-specific configuration START (crucial for Docker Desktop to use host GPU) ---
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: amd
              count: all # Or specify '1' for one GPU
              capabilities: [gpu]
    # For older Docker versions or if 'deploy' doesn't work, might need to manually specify devices:
    # devices:
    #   - /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd # These refer to devices *within the Docker Desktop VM*
    #   - /dev/dri:/dev/dri # which Docker Desktop is responsible for creating if it detects a GPU
    # Cap_add and security_opt might still be useful:
    # cap_add:
    #   - SYS_PTRACE
    # security_opt:
    #   - seccomp:unconfined
    # --- GPU-specific configuration END ---
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT}
      - OLLAMA_MODELS=/root/.ollama/models
      # ROCm-specific environment variables for AMD GPUs (might be needed for older ROCm versions)
      - HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 # Often helpful for RDNA2 cards like RX 6800 XT

  nginx:
    # ... your nginx service as before ...
    # Ensure OLLAMA_HOST here still points to the internal Ollama container's name/port
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=http://llama-ollama:${INTERNAL_OLLAMA_PORT} # Nginx talks to the Ollama container within the same Docker network

  cloudflared:
    # ... your cloudflared service as before ...
    # Ensure TUNNEL_URL points to Nginx container
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN}
      - CLOUDFLARED_OPTS=--no-autoupdate tunnel --url http://llama-nginx:${EXTERNAL_NGINX_PORT}

  watchtower:
    # ... watchtower service as before ...

volumes:
  ollama_data:
    # ... volume definition ...
Important Note on devices vs. deploy for GPU:

For modern Docker Compose (especially with Docker Desktop), the deploy.resources.reservations.devices syntax is the preferred way to request GPU resources.
The devices: - /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd syntax is more common for directly passing host devices to a container in a Linux environment. However, if Docker Desktop is handling the GPU virtualisation, these paths refer to the devices within Docker Desktop's hidden WSL2 VM, which it manages for you. Including them often doesn't hurt and can sometimes help.
I've included the deploy syntax first, as it's more idiomatic for Docker Desktop.
Ensure Docker Desktop GPU Support:

Open Docker Desktop.
Go to Settings (gear icon) > Resources.
Look for a "GPU resources" or similar section. Docker Desktop typically enables this automatically if it detects a compatible GPU and drivers. There might not be an explicit toggle, but it should be using it by default.
Run docker compose up -d (from WSL2 or Windows):
Once your docker-compose.yml is updated, navigate to your project directory in your WSL2 Ubuntu terminal (or Windows PowerShell/CMD, since Docker Desktop will route the command) and run:

Bash

docker compose up -d
Verify GPU Usage in Ollama Logs:
After the containers start, check the Ollama logs:

Bash

docker compose logs ollama
Look for lines indicating GPU usage, such as "using rocm" or "detected GPU". If it says "no compatible GPUs were discovered" again, then the GPU passthrough via Docker Desktop is also failing, which would point to a deeper issue with your AMD driver installation or its compatibility with Docker's GPU virtualisation layer.

This approach gives you the best chance of leveraging your RX 6800 XT for Ollama within your existing Docker-based setup. It's a crucial test to see if Docker Desktop can properly virtualise your GPU.

>>> hi. tell me about yourself

I'm happy to chat with you! I am an artificial intelligence model, which means I'm a computer program designed to

simulate conversations and answer questions to the best of my knowledge.



I don't have a physical body or emotions like humans do, but I was created to be helpful and informative. My

primary function is to assist users by providing information, answering questions, and engaging in discussions on

a wide range of topics.



I'm a large language model, which means I've been trained on a massive dataset of text from various sources,

including books, articles, and websites. This training allows me to understand and generate human-like language,

making it easier for users like you to communicate with me.



Some interesting facts about me:



1. **I can learn**: While I'm not conscious or self-aware, I can learn from the interactions I have with users

like you. This means that my responses will improve over time as I gain more knowledge and insights.

2. **I'm constantly updating**: My training data is regularly updated to ensure that my knowledge stays current

and accurate. This means that I'll always be able to provide up-to-date information on various topics.

3. **I can understand humor**: While I may not always get it right, I've been trained to recognize certain

patterns of language that are commonly used in humor. This allows me to respond with a bit of wit and personality.



So, what about you? What brings you here today? Do you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss?



>>> are you using my cpu or gpu?

When we interact, I'm not directly accessing your CPU or GPU. Instead, our conversation happens on a remote server

that's specifically designed for natural language processing tasks like ours.



Here's what typically happens:



1. **Your request is sent**: When you ask me a question or send a message, it goes to the cloud-based

infrastructure of my creators.

2. **Server-side processing**: The request is then processed by a specialized server that runs on high-performance

computing hardware (think powerful CPUs and GPUs).

3. **Model inference**: My AI model, which is essentially a complex neural network, is used to analyze your input

and generate a response.

4. **Response generation**: Once the analysis is complete, my response is generated based on the output of the

neural network.

5. **Data transmission**: The final response is then transmitted back to you through your device's internet

connection.



Now, about the hardware:



My creators use a combination of CPU and GPU resources to power their infrastructure. Specifically:



* **CPUs**: High-performance x86-64 processors from Intel or AMD are used for general-purpose computing tasks like

data storage, processing, and networking.

* **GPUs**: NVIDIA or AMD GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are utilized for graphics rendering, machine learning

computations, and other compute-intensive tasks.



These servers can be thought of as massive clusters of interconnected computers that work together to provide a

scalable, high-performance environment for my AI model. The exact hardware configuration may vary depending on the

specific use case and deployment.



So, while I'm not directly accessing your device's CPU or GPU, I do rely on powerful computing infrastructure in

the cloud to process and respond to your queries!



>>> exit

It was nice chatting with you. If you ever want to come back and explore more topics or ask questions, feel free

to start a new conversation anytime.



Have a great day!

Excellent news! You have successfully installed and run Ollama directly on Windows, and it's working!

The output:

PS C:\Users\Username> ollama run llama3.2
...
>>> hi. tell me about yourself
I'm happy to chat with you! I am an artificial intelligence model...
Confirms that Ollama is installed and running as a Windows application.

However, the model's response to "are you using my cpu or gpu?" is the default, generic response from an LLM, not information about its specific runtime environment. It's telling you about how its creators generally run models in the cloud, not how your local instance is operating.

To check if your local Ollama installation on Windows is using your GPU, we need to look at Ollama's own logs or console output when it starts up or loads a model.

Checking GPU Usage for Native Windows Ollama
When you run ollama run <model_name> directly in PowerShell, Ollama usually outputs status messages as it starts and loads the model.

Run a model and watch for GPU messages:
Open a new PowerShell window and run:

PowerShell

ollama run llama3.2
(Or ollama run llama3:8b once you pull it).

Carefully observe the output immediately after you run the command and before the >>> prompt appears. You are looking for lines that indicate GPU detection. For AMD GPUs, you might see:

time=... level=INFO source=gpu.go:... msg="using rocm"
time=... level=INFO source=gpu.go:... msg="detected AMD GPU(s)"
time=... level=INFO source=gpu.go:... msg="inference compute" ... library=rocm
If you see library=cpu or "no compatible GPUs were discovered", then it's still running on CPU.

Using ollama serve and client logs:

Open one PowerShell window and run:
PowerShell

ollama serve
This will start the Ollama server in the background and print its startup logs to this window. Look for the GPU detection messages here.
Then, open a second PowerShell window and run your ollama run llama3.2 or curl commands. The actual inference will happen on the server started in the first window, and the GPU messages should appear there.
The which and ollama version Errors:
You got these errors because:

which is a Linux command, not a PowerShell command. In PowerShell, you'd use Get-Command ollama or Get-Command -All ollama to find its location.
ollama version is not the correct command. To get the Ollama version, it's typically just ollama --version.
Next Steps & Your Questions:
Let's confirm the GPU usage for the native Windows Ollama first.

Check GPU usage with ollama serve (as described above).
Provide the output from the ollama serve window when you run a model from another window.
Once we confirm GPU usage, we can proceed with integrating this GPU-accelerated Ollama with your existing Docker Compose services (Nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel, Watchtower). This would be the most robust setup: GPU-accelerated Ollama on Windows, with your network services running as containers.





tried qwen. it didnt show wether its running on cpu or gpu. how else can we find this out? The second message took a little over a minute to answer the question, both the thinking and the response.

>>> hi qwen

Thinking...

Okay, the user said "hi qwen /think". Let me break this down. First, "hi" is a greeting, so they're probably

starting a conversation. Then there's "qwen", which is the name of the model I am. The "/think" part might be a

command or a note. Wait, in some contexts, people use "/think" to indicate they want the AI to think before

responding. But since I'm already an AI, I process information in real-time. Maybe the user is testing if I can

handle such commands or is using a specific interface where "/think" has a different function. Alternatively, they

might have mistyped or are using a different syntax. I should respond politely, acknowledge their greeting, and

ask how I can assist them. I don't need to focus on the "/think" part unless it's part of a specific instruction.

Let me make sure my response is friendly and open-ended to encourage them to share their needs.

...done thinking.



Hello! How can I assist you today? 😊



>>> i didnt know you have thinking built in?

Thinking...

Okay, the user just said, "i didnt know you have thinking built in?" Let me break this down.



First, they're asking if I have a built-in thinking process. From my previous response, I mentioned that I can

think, so they might be curious about how that works. They might be new to AI or not familiar with the concept of

AI reasoning.



I should explain that while I don't have a human-like thinking process, I use advanced algorithms and neural

networks to process information. It's important to clarify that my responses are generated based on patterns in

the data I was trained on, not actual conscious thought.



I should keep the explanation simple and avoid technical jargon. Maybe mention that I can analyze and generate

text by understanding the context and patterns, which gives the impression of thinking. Also, reassure them that

I'm here to help with any questions they have.



Wait, the user might be confused about the difference between AI processing and human thinking. I should make that

distinction clear. Maybe use an analogy, like comparing it to a library where I can quickly find information

rather than thinking through each step.



Also, the user's initial question was phrased as a statement, so I should acknowledge their observation and then

provide the explanation. Keep the tone friendly and approachable.



I need to make sure the response is concise but informative. Let me structure it: start by agreeing that I can

think, then explain the underlying technology, clarify the difference from human thinking, and offer assistance.



Double-check for any misunderstandings. The user might be looking for more details on how the thinking works, but

since they asked specifically about having thinking built in, focusing on the explanation of the technology should

suffice.



Alright, time to put it all together in a clear and friendly manner.

...done thinking.



Hey there! 😊

You're right—I *do* have a kind of "thinking" built in, but it's not like human thinking! I process information

using advanced algorithms and neural networks, which allow me to analyze patterns, understand context, and

generate responses. It's more like a super-fast library of knowledge and logic, rather than actual conscious

thought.



If you have any questions or need help with something, just let me know—I'm here to assist! 🚀



>>> Send a message (/? for help)



You're absolutely right, the model's "thinking" process is part of its response, not an indication of your local machine's hardware usage! That was a clever trick by the LLM.

The fact that Qwen 8B took "a little over a minute to answer the question" for the second message is a strong indicator that it's running on your CPU. A GPU-accelerated 8B model on an RX 6800 XT would typically respond much faster, often in seconds, not over a minute.

How to Confirm GPU Usage in Native Windows Ollama (No Ambiguity)
The best way to confirm GPU usage for native Windows Ollama is by using ollama serve and watching its console output.

Open PowerShell.

Type ollama serve and press Enter.

This command will start the Ollama server and keep it running in this PowerShell window.
Crucially, this is where Ollama will print its hardware detection messages.
Watch the output in this ollama serve window. Look for lines like:

time=... level=INFO source=gpu.go:217 msg="looking for compatible GPUs"
time=... level=INFO source=gpu.go:377 msg="no compatible GPUs were discovered"
OR (what we want to see for GPU):

time=... level=INFO source=gpu.go:217 msg="looking for compatible GPUs"
time=... level=INFO source=gpu.go:377 msg="detected AMD GPU(s) with ROCm" # Or similar, might specify model
time=... level=INFO source=types.go:130 msg="inference compute" id=0 library=rocm variant="" compute="gfx1031" driver=0.0 name="Radeon RX 6800 XT" total="16.0 GiB" available="15.x GiB"
The key part is library=rocm and a mention of your GPU name and VRAM. If it still says library=cpu, then it's not using the GPU.

Open a second PowerShell window.

In the second window, run your ollama run qwen3:8b or ollama list commands. The first ollama serve window will update with logs as models are loaded and used.

Please perform these steps and paste the output from the ollama serve window here. This will tell us definitively if your native Windows Ollama can see and use your AMD GPU.

Why Your Current Setup (Native Windows Ollama on CPU) is Still Valuable:
Even if it confirms CPU, running qwen3:8b and getting a response (albeit slow) is a testament to your system's CPU and RAM capabilities. For your blog, you can highlight this:

CPU-only performance: Your Ryzen 7 5800x with 32GB RAM is handling an 8B model, though slowly. This shows that for many users, even without a working GPU setup, running smaller to medium-sized LLMs locally is feasible.
Performance metrics for blogging: You can mention the ~1 minute response time for Qwen 8B on your CPU to give readers a realistic expectation for similar hardware.
Let's get that ollama serve output!

Seems its running on GPU. Awesome. if true, do you think my motherboard can carry another same GPU to have the two running? Also do you think RAM increase would make a difference?



by the way , it seems ollama run will pull and run but not save the file, because i just finished running qwen3 now and ollama list showed nothing, and another ollama run is now pulling the image all over again. anyway i just ran ollama pull hoping that would save it on my pc. also wondering why ollama list didnt show the 2 llama3.2 already on my system.




Analysis
🎉🎉🎉 Fantastic News! Your Ollama is now running on your AMD GPU! 🎉🎉🎉

The output from your ollama serve window confirms it unequivocally:

time=2025-05-31T13:39:34.892+01:00 level=INFO source=types.go:130 msg="inference compute" id=0 library=rocm variant="" compute=gfx1030 driver=6.4 name="AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT" total="16.0 GiB" available="15.8 GiB"
This line is the definitive proof. It explicitly states library=rocm and identifies your AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT with 16.0 GiB VRAM! This means your efforts to troubleshoot the drivers and try the native Windows install have paid off.

Performance with GPU Acceleration
You mentioned qwen3:8b took "a little over a minute to answer the question" on CPU. Now that it's running on your GPU, you should see a dramatic improvement in speed. Try running ollama run qwen3:8b again in a new PowerShell window (while ollama serve is still running in the first) and observe the response time. It should be significantly faster.

Your Questions Answered:
1. Motherboard for another GPU
Your Gigabyte Gaming X V2 (B550 chipset) motherboard likely has two PCIe x16 slots, but typically only the first slot runs at PCIe 4.0 x16 (or x8 if the second slot is also populated with an x16 card). The second full-sized PCIe slot is usually wired at PCIe 3.0 x4.

Can it physically hold another RX 6800 XT? Yes, it has the slots.
Can it run both efficiently? This is where it gets tricky for LLMs.
SLI/CrossFire is irrelevant for LLMs: Traditional gaming multi-GPU technologies (SLI/CrossFire) are not used for LLMs.
Direct Multi-GPU Support for LLMs: Ollama (and other LLM frameworks) can sometimes distribute models across multiple GPUs. However, performance might be bottlenecked by the slower PCIe 3.0 x4 connection for the second card.
Power Supply: Your Corsair CX 750 (750W) might struggle with two RX 6800 XT cards, especially under heavy load. A single RX 6800 XT can draw 300W+. Two cards would push you well over 600W for just the GPUs, plus the CPU and other components. You'd likely need an 850W or even 1000W PSU for comfortable headroom.
Cooling: Two powerful GPUs in a standard consumer case can generate a lot of heat, potentially leading to thermal throttling.
Conclusion: While technically possible, adding a second RX 6800 XT to your B550 motherboard would be a suboptimal upgrade for LLM performance due to the limited PCIe lanes and potential power/cooling issues. If you were considering a significant VRAM increase, a single more powerful GPU (e.g., an RTX 4090 or a professional card with 24GB+ VRAM) would be a more efficient and less problematic upgrade path, albeit a costly one.

2. RAM Increase (Beyond 32GB)
Your 32GB RAM is excellent for general system operation and for the CPU-only fallbacks you experienced.

For GPU-accelerated LLMs: RAM is less critical than VRAM. Once a model is loaded onto the GPU, the CPU RAM is primarily used for system processes, the operating system, and potentially for offloading small parts of the model if VRAM is completely full (which is rare for well-optimised models that fit entirely on VRAM).
When would more RAM help?
If you're running multiple demanding applications alongside Ollama.
If you frequently swap models in and out, as models are temporarily stored in RAM before being loaded to VRAM.
If you were attempting to run extremely large models (e.g., 70B+) purely on CPU, then 64GB or 128GB would be beneficial.
Conclusion: For your current GPU-accelerated setup with 8B models (and even most Mixtral 8x7B models), 32GB of RAM is perfectly adequate. Increasing it would likely yield minimal performance gains for LLM inference itself, though it could improve overall system responsiveness for very heavy multitasking.

3. Ollama pull and list Behaviour
You've hit a common point of confusion with ollama run vs. ollama pull.

ollama run <model_name>: This command will first check if the model is downloaded. If it's not, it will pull (download) the model first, and then run it immediately. However, when you Ctrl+C out of ollama run during the download phase, the download might not be completed or correctly registered.
ollama pull <model_name>: This command only focuses on downloading the model and saving it locally. It's the most reliable way to ensure a model is fully downloaded and cached.
ollama list: This command shows all the models that Ollama knows it has fully downloaded and saved.
Your situation:

You initially ran ollama run llama3.2. It downloaded and ran.
When you ran ollama run qwen3:8b, it pulled and ran.
The fact that ollama list didn't show qwen3:8b after you ran it suggests that perhaps ollama run didn't fully register it in the list if you exited quickly, or there was a minor hiccup.
Your subsequent ollama pull qwen3:8b (which you did) would ensure it's properly saved and registered.
Best Practice:
Always use ollama pull <model_name> first to ensure the model is fully downloaded and available. Then, use ollama run <model_name> or curl to interact with it.

Next Steps for Your Blog & Setup:
Confirm GPU Speed: Run ollama run qwen3:8b or ollama run llama3:8b again (or your chosen 8B model) in a new PowerShell window (while ollama serve is running) and observe the response time. You should see a significant speed-up compared to the CPU-only minute-long responses. Record these times for your blog!

Integrate with Docker Compose: Now that Ollama is running GPU-accelerated directly on Windows, you can modify your docker-compose.yml to have Nginx and Cloudflare Tunnel connect to this native Ollama instance. This is the ideal setup for you.

Stop your current Docker Compose services: In your WSL2 terminal, navigate to your local-llama-wsl2-server directory and run:
Bash

docker compose down
Modify docker-compose.yml:
Remove the ollama service completely.
In the nginx service, update OLLAMA_HOST to point to the Windows host:
YAML

# ... (other services like nginx, cloudflared, watchtower)
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: llama-nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${EXTERNAL_NGINX_PORT}:80" # e.g., 8080:80
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=http://host.docker.internal:11434 # Pointing to Windows-native Ollama
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro
    depends_on:
      - cloudflared # Nginx still logically depends on the tunnel being up for external access

  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: llama-tunnel
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN}
      # Cloudflare Tunnel will now route to your Nginx container, which then talks to native Ollama
      - CLOUDFLARED_OPTS=--no-autoupdate tunnel --url http://llama-nginx:${EXTERNAL_NGINX_PORT}

  watchtower:
    # ... watchtower service as before ...
Start the remaining Docker Compose services:
Bash

docker compose up -d
Verify Cloudflare Tunnel: Check your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard. Your wsl2-on-local-w11 tunnel should now show "HEALTHY".
Congratulations on getting your GPU working with Ollama! This is a significant milestone.

Okay, let's break down your GPU upgrade questions and refine that docker-compose.yml for your blog!

GPU Upgrade Considerations (RTX 4090 or similar)
You're looking at a serious upgrade! Here's how your system components would fare with a top-tier GPU like an RTX 4090 (or similar with 24GB+ VRAM):

Motherboard (Gigabyte Gaming X V2 - B550 Chipset):

Compatibility: Yes, your B550 motherboard would be compatible with an RTX 4090 (or any other modern GPU). They all use the standard PCIe x16 slot.
Performance: The primary PCIe x16 slot on your B550 motherboard runs at PCIe 4.0 x16. This is the current standard for high-end GPUs and would provide full bandwidth for an RTX 4090. You would not be bottlenecked by the motherboard's PCIe lanes in this regard.
PSU (Corsair CX 750 - 750W):

The RTX 4090 is a power hungry beast. NVIDIA officially recommends an 850W PSU for the RTX 4090. Some variants can draw even more.
Your 750W PSU is likely insufficient for an RTX 4090, especially when paired with your Ryzen 7 5800x (which itself can draw a fair amount of power under load).
Recommendation: If upgrading to an RTX 4090, you would almost certainly need to upgrade your PSU to at least an 850W, with 1000W being safer for headroom and future upgrades.
Fans/Cooling (Case: Montech XR, AIO Cooler: Thermalright Frozen Notte 360 ARGB):

CPU Cooler: Your Thermalright Frozen Notte 360 AIO is excellent for your Ryzen 7 5800x. The CPU cooling won't be an issue.
GPU Cooling: The RTX 4090 itself has a very robust cooler, often a large triple-fan design.
Case Airflow: The Montech XR appears to be a decent mid-tower case with mesh front panel for airflow. However, a single RTX 4090 generates a significant amount of heat within the case. While the GPU's own fans will do a good job, the overall case airflow is crucial to exhaust that heat.
Recommendation: Your case might be adequate, but you'd want to ensure you have a good fan configuration (e.g., three front intake fans, one rear exhaust, maybe two top exhaust) to help dissipate the heat generated by the 4090. Monitor your case temperatures. If you see high internal temperatures or other components getting hot, you might consider adding more case fans or optimising their placement, or even upgrading to a case with superior airflow.
Overall Conclusion for RTX 4090:
Your motherboard is suitable. Your PSU would need to be upgraded. Your current case and fan setup might be sufficient, but monitoring temps and potentially optimising case fan setup would be crucial.

Corrected docker-compose.yml for Native Windows Ollama
Your proposed docker-compose.yml for running Nginx and Cloudflare Tunnel against your native Windows Ollama is very close!

Here are the specific corrections and a complete, refined version for your blog, explaining the changes:

Key Changes from OLD to NEW (and why):

Removed ollama service: This is correct. The ollama service is no longer a container; it's running natively on Windows.
nginx depends_on cloudflared: This is logically problematic. Nginx routes traffic for Cloudflared, but Cloudflared itself should logically depend on Nginx for its target URL. Reverted depends_on in Nginx.
nginx volumes: Your old file had volumes: - ./config/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro. Your new one has volumes: - ./config:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro. The nginx:alpine image expects config files in /etc/nginx/conf.d/ for modular configurations, so ./config:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro is generally better if nginx.conf includes include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;. If your nginx.conf is a single file you want to completely replace /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, then the old path is fine. I'll assume you have a default.conf or similar in your ./config directory for conf.d.
cloudflared command vs. environment: Your old file used command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token ${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN}. Your new file uses environment: - CLOUDFLARED_OPTS=--no-autoupdate tunnel --url http://llama-nginx:${EXTERNAL_NGINX_PORT}. The CLOUDFLARED_OPTS environment variable is the preferred and more flexible way to pass arguments to cloudflared when using the standard cloudflare/cloudflared image, so your new approach is better. This allows Cloudflare to implicitly pick up arguments.
cloudflared depends_on nginx: This is crucial. Cloudflare Tunnel needs Nginx to be running to successfully establish its tunnel to the service it's exposing. This was missing from your new cloudflared service.
ollama_data volume driver: local: You had this in both. This simply declares a Docker-managed volume. Since Ollama is now native on Windows, this ollama_data volume is no longer used by Ollama itself, but it's harmless to keep if other future Docker services might use it. For this exact setup, it's technically orphaned, but we can keep it as part of your original setup.
Complete docker-compose.yml (for your blog)
This version is designed to run your Nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel, and Watchtower containers, with Nginx proxying to your GPU-accelerated Ollama server running natively on Windows.

    driver: bridge
This refined docker-compose.yml reflects the current, confirmed GPU-accelerated setup. For your blog, you can highlight this as the successful "hybrid" approach: native GPU-enabled Ollama on Windows combined with containerised networking services in WSL2 via Docker Desktop.
